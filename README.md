What is a null channel?


Some Experiments


Null channel is a way to turn a channel off. They always block.


Alternative to a closed channel.

##  V01 - Channel.
Channel returns a zero, but is not blocking.


## V02 - null channel
Instead of checking for zero, check for OK.

## V03 - null channels, but chaning sleep time to demonstrate randomness of return of goRoutines.


To be honest, I got your null pointer question wrong.
